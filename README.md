# Person Class, Queue, Quicksort
This program prompts the user to input information about 5 people based on a Person class, which are stored in an instance of a custom queue implementation. The contents of the queue are then displayed to the user and the queue is sorted in descending order using quicksort based on the last name and age of the person objects inside it.
